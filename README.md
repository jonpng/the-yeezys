INSTALL USING final.dmg  
Sorry no EXE Windows Users, you can run final.jar though.

---

Hi. final is the folder structure for the application, M4 is the folder structure for our coding.
To build the app, navigate to /final in the terminal and run:
```
gradle assemble
```

The final app is going to be located in:
```
build/distributions/bundles/final.app
```

We already have a dmg for installation in the top level of this repo.

This doesn't work in windows btw, as of now. Probably never after this semester.

Do not import the files. You can get access to them just by opening the file location.

Then build and run using:
```
Build -> Make Project
Run -> Run 'fxapp.MainFXApplication'
```

To run tasks in the gradle files, you gotta do:
```
gradle -b <file.gradle> <task>
```

All files relating to M2 are in the M2 folder and zip folder.
